- [ ] Create dashboards for operation tracking and analysis
- [ ] Implement alerting for integration failures and performance issues

## Research and Investigation

### Performance Analysis
- [ ] Conduct detailed performance analysis of tmux vs direct integration approaches
- [ ] Research alternative isolation mechanisms for cursor-agent operations
- [ ] Investigate caching strategies for improved response times
- [ ] Analyze resource usage patterns and optimization opportunities

### Integration Patterns
- [ ] Research best practices for AI agent coordination and management
- [ ] Investigate patterns for autonomous workflow orchestration
- [ ] Study approaches for multi-modal AI integration (text, code, images)
- [ ] Research governance models for autonomous AI operations

### Security and Compliance
- [ ] Conduct security audit of cursor-agent integration
- [ ] Research compliance requirements for autonomous AI operations
- [ ] Investigate access control patterns for multi-user environments
- [ ] Study data privacy implications of workspace context sharing

## Deprecated/Resolved Items

### Completed
- [x] CursorAgentProvider implementation and integration
- [x] tmux-based session isolation to prevent hanging
- [x] JSON parsing with robust error handling
- [x] Session caching and management system
- [x] MCP server integration and tool registration
- [x] Provider auto-registration and configuration support

### No Longer Relevant
- ~~Manual cursor-agent authentication handling~~ (Solved: Uses existing Cursor login)
- ~~Direct cursor-agent process management~~ (Solved: tmux isolation approach)
- ~~Custom JSON protocol implementation~~ (Solved: cursor-agent provides JSON output)
