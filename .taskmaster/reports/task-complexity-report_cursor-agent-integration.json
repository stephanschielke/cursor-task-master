			"taskTitle": "Implement CursorAgentProvider Base Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the CursorAgentProvider implementation into core architectural components: tmux session management with unique naming and cleanup, AI SDK compatible method implementation (generateText/generateObject), JSON parsing with auto-repair for malformed responses, and timeout/error handling with fallback strategies. Focus on extending the existing BaseAIProvider class structure already present in the codebase.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to existing infrastructure in place. The CursorAgentProvider class already exists with substantial implementation, requiring enhancement rather than creation from scratch. Complex tmux process management and JSON parsing logic needed, but foundation exists."

			"taskTitle": "Enhance MCP Server with FastMCP Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into comprehensive MCP integration components: FastMCP framework integration with existing MCP server architecture, direct function wrapper creation for all TaskMaster MCP tools, cursor-agent provider integration within existing MCP tools, recursive tool calling capability implementation, execution context management for CursorAgent sessions, and structured error handling with recovery mechanisms. Leverage existing MCP infrastructure in mcp-server directory.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to architectural changes required across the existing MCP server infrastructure. Multiple integration points with FastMCP protocol, recursive capabilities, and backward compatibility requirements increase complexity significantly."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into configuration system components: extension of existing .taskmaster/config.json structure to support cursor-agent settings, dynamic provider selection with cursor-agent as default main model, and automatic detection/validation of cursor-agent availability with graceful fallback mechanisms. Build upon existing configuration structure visible in .taskmaster/config.json.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to existing configuration system in place. The .taskmaster/config.json already shows cursor-agent integration with models configuration. Requires enhancement and validation logic rather than complete rebuild."

This is a complex architectural framework requiring careful design.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as this represents a novel recursive framework that doesn't exist in current architecture. Requires sophisticated state management, recursion control, hardware monitoring, and integration with multiple MCP operations. High risk of infinite loops and resource management challenges."

Build upon existing progress tracking infrastructure in the codebase.",
			"reasoning": "High-medium complexity due to multi-modal progress tracking requirements across CLI and MCP contexts. WebSocket integration and nested progress visualization for recursive operations adds significant complexity. Real-time updates require careful state management."

Leverage existing jsonrepair integration visible in the codebase.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity with existing jsonrepair integration already present in CursorAgentProvider. Requires sophisticated error pattern recognition and recovery strategies, but foundation exists. Streaming JSON parsing adds complexity."

Build upon substantial existing CursorAgentProvider implementation.",

The CursorAgentProvider class already contains most core functionality, requiring enhancement and robustness improvements rather than ground-up development. Complex error handling and workspace integration adds complexity."
