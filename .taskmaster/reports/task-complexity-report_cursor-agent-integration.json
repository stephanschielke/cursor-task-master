			"expansionPrompt": "This is an enterprise-level system requiring deep AI/ML expertise, distributed systems knowledge, and integration with multiple external MCP research tools. Break down into: 1) ResearchOrchestrator class with NLP query analysis engine, 2) MCP tool integration framework for mcp-deepwebresearch/context7/fetch tools, 3) ML-based tool selection algorithm, 4) Parallel orchestration engine with connection pooling and rate limiting, 5) Result synthesis engine with semantic analysis and deduplication, 6) Research caching with semantic hashing, 7) Quality assessment with confidence scoring, 8) Workflow templates for cursor-agent use cases, 9) Learning system for continuous improvement, 10) Session management with context preservation, 11) Integration testing with real MCP tools, 12) Performance optimization and monitoring. Each subtask requires significant technical depth and careful architecture.",
			"reasoning": "Task 14 represents maximum complexity (10/10) due to: (1) Integration with multiple external MCP research tools requiring deep understanding of their APIs and capabilities, (2) Advanced NLP techniques for query categorization and analysis, (3) Machine learning models for intelligent tool selection and optimization, (4) Distributed systems challenges with parallel orchestration, connection pooling, and rate limiting, (5) Complex result synthesis requiring semantic analysis and content deduplication, (6) Enterprise-grade caching with semantic similarity matching, (7) Quality assessment algorithms with confidence scoring and source verification, (8) Learning systems that improve over time, (9) Session management with context preservation across related queries, (10) Performance requirements for real-time orchestration across multiple concurrent research calls. The existing research infrastructure shows sophisticated patterns but Task 14 extends far beyond current capabilities, requiring fundamental architectural changes and new AI/ML components."
