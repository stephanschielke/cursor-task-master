			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize CursorAgentProvider Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the finalization of CursorAgentProvider into focused validation and enhancement tasks. Analyze the current implementation in src/ai-providers/cursor-agent.js which already has comprehensive functionality including tmux session management, JSON auto-repair, AI SDK compatibility, and progress tracking. Focus on integration testing, edge case handling, and production-ready validation rather than core feature development.",
			"reasoning": "Task has existing comprehensive implementation with 6 completed subtasks covering unit testing, configuration validation, and core functionality. Main work involves validation, integration testing, and production hardening rather than net-new development. Medium complexity due to testing and validation requirements."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Recursive MCP Operation Framework",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Develop a sophisticated framework for recursive MCP operations with autonomous task optimization. Build on the existing MCP infrastructure visible in mcp-server/src/tools/ directory. Create RecursiveMCPOperation schema, hardware-based recursion limits, circuit breaker patterns, progress callbacks, and error recovery mechanisms. Focus on autonomous task optimization engine that can recursively modify TaskMaster state using expand_task, scope_up_task, and scope_down_task operations.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity architectural task requiring new framework development. Involves sophisticated concepts like hardware monitoring, circuit breakers, recursive workflows, and autonomous optimization. Complex integration with existing MCP tools and state management. Requires deep system design and careful implementation."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Progress Tracking and Visual Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build a comprehensive progress tracking system with real-time visual feedback for complex operations. Extend existing progress tracking capabilities seen in cursor-agent.js (createCursorAgentProgressTracker, createRecursiveCursorAgentProgressTracker). Implement ASCII progress bars, nested progress tracking for recursive operations, WebSocket-based updates for MCP clients, and telemetry integration. Focus on CLI visualization, MCP client integration, and performance metrics collection.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately high complexity involving multiple display modes (CLI, MCP), real-time updates, nested tracking, and telemetry integration. Building on existing progress tracking foundation but extending significantly. Requires UI/UX considerations and cross-platform compatibility."

			"taskTitle": "Create JSONAutoRepair Utility Class",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Extract and consolidate existing JSON auto-repair functionality from BaseAIProvider and CursorAgentProvider into a reusable utility class. Review current JSON repair implementation in cursor-agent.js (lines 223-237 using jsonrepair library) and BaseAIProvider. Create a centralized JSONAutoRepair utility with basic repair methods, unified interface, and simple validation. Focus on consolidation rather than new feature development.",
			"reasoning": "Lower complexity refactoring task focused on code consolidation. Main work involves extracting existing functionality rather than building new features. Requires understanding current implementations and creating clean abstractions, but relatively straightforward."

			"taskTitle": "Finalize CursorAgentProvider Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Complete the production-ready integration of CursorAgentProvider by focusing on comprehensive validation and final enhancements. Validate existing tmux session management, test JSON auto-repair with edge cases, verify timeout management, test error recovery mechanisms, validate health monitoring, and ensure streaming response handling. Focus on integration testing with actual cursor-agent CLI, workspace context injection validation, and performance optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately high complexity integration and validation task. Builds on Task 1's foundation but focuses on production readiness, integration testing, and comprehensive validation. Requires thorough testing across multiple scenarios and edge cases."
