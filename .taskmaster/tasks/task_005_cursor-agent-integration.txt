# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Advanced Progress Tracking and Visual Feedback
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create real-time progress tracking system with visual feedback for complex recursive workflows and long-running cursor-agent operations.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive progress tracking system: 1) Create ProgressTracker class with real-time updates for cursor-agent operations, 2) Add visual progress indicators for CLI operations using ASCII progress bars and spinners, 3) Implement nested progress tracking for recursive MCP operations with hierarchical display, 4) Create WebSocket-based progress updates for MCP clients (Cursor IDE integration), 5) Add operation timing and performance metrics collection, 6) Implement progress persistence for long-running operations that can be resumed, 7) Create progress callback system for recursive workflows with depth-aware visualization, 8) Add telemetry integration for tracking cursor-agent usage patterns and performance metrics. Include timeout visualization and estimated completion times.

# Test Strategy:
Test progress tracking accuracy with mock operations. Verify visual feedback rendering in CLI and MCP contexts. Test nested progress tracking with recursive operations. Integration tests with WebSocket connections. Performance tests for progress update overhead.
