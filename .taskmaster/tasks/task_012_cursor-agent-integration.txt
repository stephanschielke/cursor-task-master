# Task ID: 12
# Title: Enhance Error Recovery and Fallback Strategy
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 6, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement robust error handling with automatic JSON repair, retry logic with exponential backoff, timeout detection, and seamless fallback to API providers when cursor-agent is unavailable.
# Details:
Build comprehensive error recovery system: 1) Enhance existing JSONAutoRepair utility from Task 6 with advanced repair strategies including bracket matching, quote escaping, and partial response reconstruction for cursor-agent outputs, 2) Implement intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff (initial 1s, max 30s) and jitter to prevent thundering herd effects during cursor-agent failures, 3) Create timeout detection and recovery system that can detect hung cursor-agent processes and gracefully terminate tmux sessions while preserving partial results, 4) Build seamless provider fallback mechanism that automatically switches to API providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) when cursor-agent is unavailable, maintaining operation continuity, 5) Implement error classification system that categorizes failures (network, authentication, model unavailable, JSON malformed) and applies appropriate recovery strategies, 6) Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures during extended cursor-agent outages, 7) Create error reporting and metrics collection for production monitoring and debugging, 8) Implement graceful degradation modes that can operate with reduced functionality when primary systems fail

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for enhanced JSON repair with complex malformed responses including nested objects, arrays, and streaming data. Test retry logic with mock cursor-agent failures and verify exponential backoff timing. Create timeout scenarios with hanging processes and verify graceful termination. Test fallback provider switching with cursor-agent unavailable scenarios. Integration tests with actual cursor-agent failures and recovery. Load tests for circuit breaker functionality under sustained failures. End-to-end tests verifying operation continuity during provider transitions.
