# Task ID: 1
# Title: Finalize CursorAgentProvider Implementation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Complete the existing CursorAgentProvider class with minor robustness improvements and basic testing coverage.
# Details:
Enhance the existing CursorAgentProvider class with: 1) Review and optimize tmux session cleanup to prevent leaks, 2) Add basic error logging for failed cursor-agent executions, 3) Verify timeout handling works correctly with current implementation, 4) Ensure JSON parsing handles common malformed response patterns, 5) Add simple configuration validation for model selection. The core functionality is already implemented including tmux isolation, generateText/generateObject methods, and fallback mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Basic unit tests for session cleanup and error handling. Simple integration test to verify the provider works with mock cursor-agent responses. Focus on testing the cleanup mechanisms and basic functionality rather than comprehensive coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Optimize Tmux Session Management and Cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and enhance the existing tmux-based process isolation system to prevent session leaks and improve resource management.
### Details:
Analyze the current direct process execution implementation in _executeCursorAgentCore() method which uses bash spawning instead of tmux. The current implementation creates unique session IDs (cursor-agent-${timestamp}-${random}) and manages process cleanup via removeAllListeners() and SIGTERM/SIGKILL. Tasks: 1) Verify the cleanup() function properly terminates child processes and removes temp files, 2) Add session leak detection and prevention mechanisms, 3) Implement proper timeout handling for zombie processes, 4) Add process monitoring to detect and clean up orphaned cursor-agent processes, 5) Test cleanup behavior under various failure scenarios (process killed, timeout, connection loss), 6) Add logging for session lifecycle events to aid in debugging cleanup issues.

## 2. Enhance AI SDK Method Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refine the generateText, generateObject, and streamObject methods to ensure full compatibility with AI SDK patterns and improve error handling.
### Details:
Review the existing AI SDK compatible interface in getClient() method and the implementation of generateText(), generateObject(), and streamObject() methods. The current implementation includes progress tracking, model mapping via mapModelIdToCursorAgent(), and proper usage reporting. Tasks: 1) Validate generateText() method returns proper usage metrics and handles cursor-agent response format correctly, 2) Test generateObject() schema instruction building in _buildSchemaInstructions() for various object types (newTaskData, PRD parsing, etc.), 3) Verify streamObject() wrapper properly emulates streaming behavior with partialObjectStream, 4) Ensure proper error propagation and timeout handling across all methods, 5) Add validation for cursor-agent CLI availability and version compatibility, 6) Test model mapping and validate supported models (sonnet, gpt-5, opus) work correctly.

## 3. Strengthen JSON Parsing and Auto-Repair System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the existing JSON parsing logic to handle more edge cases in cursor-agent responses and improve the repair mechanisms.
### Details:
Examine the current JSON parsing implementation in _parseCompletionFromOutput() and the repair logic in generateObject() method. The system currently uses jsonrepair library and handles ANSI color code removal, balanced brace counting, and fallback parsing. Tasks: 1) Test the JSON extraction logic with malformed cursor-agent responses (incomplete JSON, extra text, control characters), 2) Enhance the balanced brace counting algorithm in _parseCompletionFromOutput() to handle nested objects more reliably, 3) Improve ANSI code stripping to handle more terminal escape sequences, 4) Add additional fallback strategies for JSON extraction when primary parsing fails, 5) Implement better error messages when JSON repair fails to provide debugging context, 6) Add unit tests for common malformed JSON patterns encountered with cursor-agent responses.

## 4. Implement Configuration Validation and Error Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add robust configuration validation for model selection and improve error recovery mechanisms with proper logging throughout the provider.
### Details:
Enhance the provider's configuration handling and error recovery capabilities. Current implementation has model mapping, timeout management via TimeoutManager, and basic error logging. Tasks: 1) Add validation for cursor-agent CLI installation and accessibility via command-line checks, 2) Implement proper error logging for failed cursor-agent executions with structured error data, 3) Verify timeout handling in TimeoutManager.withTimeout() works correctly with the 120-second limit, 4) Add configuration validation for model IDs and ensure proper fallback when unsupported models are specified, 5) Implement health checks for cursor-agent responsiveness and authentication status, 6) Add structured logging throughout the execution pipeline to aid in debugging issues, 7) Enhance error messages to provide actionable troubleshooting steps for common cursor-agent failures.

## 5. Create Basic Unit Tests and Mock Framework [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement essential unit tests for CursorAgentProvider core functionality
### Details:
Create a focused test suite for CursorAgentProvider that covers core functionality without requiring full integration testing. Tasks include: 1) Set up Jest test environment for CursorAgentProvider testing, 2) Create mock cursor-agent CLI responses for testing, 3) Implement unit tests for provider instantiation and configuration, 4) Test generateText and generateObject methods with mock responses, 5) Create tests for error handling scenarios with controlled failures, 6) Test tmux session management with mock process spawning, 7) Add basic smoke tests that can run without actual cursor-agent CLI installed, 8) Create test fixtures for common cursor-agent response patterns.

I'll update the subtask details based on the user's progress report. Let me analyze the completed work and generate the appropriate update text.

Based on the comprehensive progress report, here's the new text content to append to the subtask details:

**UPDATE - Unit Test Framework Implementation Completed:**

Test framework successfully established with comprehensive coverage structure. Created complete test file at `tests/unit/ai-providers/cursor-agent.test.js` containing 18 test cases covering all core CursorAgentProvider functionality including instantiation, generateText, generateObject, streamText, error handling, and model configuration. Implemented reusable test utilities (createMockCursorAgentResponse, testPatterns) and followed established TaskMaster testing patterns with proper Jest configuration.

**Technical Challenge Identified:** Discovered Jest mock compatibility issues with current ESM configuration preventing proper mock function execution. Mock structure is correct but requires technical adjustments to work with project's test setup. All test cases are structurally complete and ready for execution once mocking issues are resolved.

**Foundation Complete:** Established comprehensive test foundation with proper mocking patterns for external dependencies (child_process, utils, timeout-manager, progress trackers). Test coverage includes all critical paths and error scenarios. Ready to proceed with mock compatibility fixes and test execution validation.

## 7. Implement Cursor-Agent Session Warming and Chat ID Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add in-memory session caching to the MCP server to enable cursor-agent session reuse across multiple calls in the same context/directory, reducing context overhead and improving response times.
### Details:
Implement a comprehensive session warming system:

1. **MCP Server Session Cache**: Create an in-memory cache that stores active cursor-agent chat IDs mapped by context (directory path, model, etc.)

2. **Session Reuse Logic**: Modify CursorAgentProvider to check the cache before creating new sessions, with configurable feature flag to enable/disable reuse

3. **Session Lifecycle Management**: 
   - Track session creation timestamps and activity
   - Implement TTL (time-to-live) policies for session expiration
   - Handle session cleanup when contexts change or sessions become stale

4. **Configuration Options**:
   - Feature flag: `CURSOR_AGENT_SESSION_REUSE` (default: enabled)
   - Session TTL: `CURSOR_AGENT_SESSION_TTL` (default: 30 minutes)
   - Max sessions per context: `CURSOR_AGENT_MAX_SESSIONS` (default: 3)

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Update `_executeCursorAgentCore()` to check cache before creating sessionId
   - Modify response parsing to update session cache with latest activity
   - Add session management endpoints to MCP server for debugging

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Reduce context re-establishment overhead
   - Maintain conversation history across related operations
   - Smart session invalidation on significant context changes (file modifications, directory changes)

This enhancement will significantly improve cursor-agent performance for iterative operations like task expansion, updates, and analysis within the same project context.
