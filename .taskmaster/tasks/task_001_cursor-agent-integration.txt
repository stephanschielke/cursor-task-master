# Task ID: 1
# Title: Finalize CursorAgentProvider Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: low
# Description: Complete the existing CursorAgentProvider class with minor robustness improvements and basic testing coverage.
# Details:
Enhance the existing CursorAgentProvider class with: 1) Review and optimize tmux session cleanup to prevent leaks, 2) Add basic error logging for failed cursor-agent executions, 3) Verify timeout handling works correctly with current implementation, 4) Ensure JSON parsing handles common malformed response patterns, 5) Add simple configuration validation for model selection. The core functionality is already implemented including tmux isolation, generateText/generateObject methods, and fallback mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Basic unit tests for session cleanup and error handling. Simple integration test to verify the provider works with mock cursor-agent responses. Focus on testing the cleanup mechanisms and basic functionality rather than comprehensive coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Optimize Tmux Session Management and Cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and enhance the existing tmux-based process isolation system to prevent session leaks and improve resource management.
### Details:
Analyze the current direct process execution implementation in _executeCursorAgentCore() method which uses bash spawning instead of tmux. The current implementation creates unique session IDs (cursor-agent-${timestamp}-${random}) and manages process cleanup via removeAllListeners() and SIGTERM/SIGKILL. Tasks: 1) Verify the cleanup() function properly terminates child processes and removes temp files, 2) Add session leak detection and prevention mechanisms, 3) Implement proper timeout handling for zombie processes, 4) Add process monitoring to detect and clean up orphaned cursor-agent processes, 5) Test cleanup behavior under various failure scenarios (process killed, timeout, connection loss), 6) Add logging for session lifecycle events to aid in debugging cleanup issues.

## 2. Enhance AI SDK Method Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refine the generateText, generateObject, and streamObject methods to ensure full compatibility with AI SDK patterns and improve error handling.
### Details:
Review the existing AI SDK compatible interface in getClient() method and the implementation of generateText(), generateObject(), and streamObject() methods. The current implementation includes progress tracking, model mapping via mapModelIdToCursorAgent(), and proper usage reporting. Tasks: 1) Validate generateText() method returns proper usage metrics and handles cursor-agent response format correctly, 2) Test generateObject() schema instruction building in _buildSchemaInstructions() for various object types (newTaskData, PRD parsing, etc.), 3) Verify streamObject() wrapper properly emulates streaming behavior with partialObjectStream, 4) Ensure proper error propagation and timeout handling across all methods, 5) Add validation for cursor-agent CLI availability and version compatibility, 6) Test model mapping and validate supported models (sonnet, gpt-5, opus) work correctly.

## 3. Strengthen JSON Parsing and Auto-Repair System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the existing JSON parsing logic to handle more edge cases in cursor-agent responses and improve the repair mechanisms.
### Details:
Examine the current JSON parsing implementation in _parseCompletionFromOutput() and the repair logic in generateObject() method. The system currently uses jsonrepair library and handles ANSI color code removal, balanced brace counting, and fallback parsing. Tasks: 1) Test the JSON extraction logic with malformed cursor-agent responses (incomplete JSON, extra text, control characters), 2) Enhance the balanced brace counting algorithm in _parseCompletionFromOutput() to handle nested objects more reliably, 3) Improve ANSI code stripping to handle more terminal escape sequences, 4) Add additional fallback strategies for JSON extraction when primary parsing fails, 5) Implement better error messages when JSON repair fails to provide debugging context, 6) Add unit tests for common malformed JSON patterns encountered with cursor-agent responses.

## 4. Implement Configuration Validation and Error Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add robust configuration validation for model selection and improve error recovery mechanisms with proper logging throughout the provider.
### Details:
Enhance the provider's configuration handling and error recovery capabilities. Current implementation has model mapping, timeout management via TimeoutManager, and basic error logging. Tasks: 1) Add validation for cursor-agent CLI installation and accessibility via command-line checks, 2) Implement proper error logging for failed cursor-agent executions with structured error data, 3) Verify timeout handling in TimeoutManager.withTimeout() works correctly with the 120-second limit, 4) Add configuration validation for model IDs and ensure proper fallback when unsupported models are specified, 5) Implement health checks for cursor-agent responsiveness and authentication status, 6) Add structured logging throughout the execution pipeline to aid in debugging issues, 7) Enhance error messages to provide actionable troubleshooting steps for common cursor-agent failures.

## 5. Create Basic Unit Tests and Mock Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement essential unit tests for CursorAgentProvider core functionality
### Details:
Create a focused test suite for CursorAgentProvider that covers core functionality without requiring full integration testing. Tasks include: 1) Set up Jest test environment for CursorAgentProvider testing, 2) Create mock cursor-agent CLI responses for testing, 3) Implement unit tests for provider instantiation and configuration, 4) Test generateText and generateObject methods with mock responses, 5) Create tests for error handling scenarios with controlled failures, 6) Test tmux session management with mock process spawning, 7) Add basic smoke tests that can run without actual cursor-agent CLI installed, 8) Create test fixtures for common cursor-agent response patterns.

## 6. Add Configuration Validation for Model Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement validation for cursor-agent model configuration and availability checking
### Details:
Add configuration validation to ensure cursor-agent settings are properly configured. Tasks include: 1) Validate model mapping between TaskMaster model IDs and cursor-agent CLI model names (sonnet-4 â†’ sonnet), 2) Add cursor-agent availability checking using 'cursor-agent --version' command, 3) Implement model availability validation for specified models, 4) Add configuration health checks that can be used in monitoring, 5) Create warning system for deprecated or unavailable models, 6) Add fallback model suggestion when primary model is unavailable, 7) Integrate configuration validation with existing config-manager system.
