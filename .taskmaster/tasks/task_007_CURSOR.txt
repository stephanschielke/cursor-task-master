- Full model metadata including capabilities and context lengths
- Follows the same pattern as other AI providers in the codebase
- Integrated with existing model mapping logic in mapModelIdToCursorAgent()
- Supports established provider interface expectations
- Handles cases where cursor-agent is not available or authenticated

**Validation:** Method tested and confirmed working with proper model information return.

## 2. Execute comprehensive testing validation [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1

## 4. Fix cursor-agent fallback provider validation warning [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve invalid fallback provider "cursor-agent" warning in .taskmaster/config.json by updating provider validation logic
### Details:
The system is showing a warning that cursor-agent is not recognized as a valid fallback provider. Need to investigate and fix the provider validation in config-manager.js to recognize cursor-agent as a legitimate provider option for fallback configuration.

Looking at the investigation findings provided in the user request, I can see this is a detailed technical analysis of a provider validation warning issue. The findings show that the validation logic appears correct but there's an anomaly in how/when the warning appears. Let me provide the new content to append to the subtask details:

Investigation completed with comprehensive analysis of cursor-agent validation system. Found that provider is correctly registered in CUSTOM_PROVIDERS and validates successfully in isolation tests. Warning originates from config-manager.js fallback validation check, but appears to be context or timing dependent since direct validation returns true. Identified potential edge case where config loading context affects validation behavior. Need to test CLI commands directly to reproduce warning conditions and add debug logging to config-manager.js validation flow to identify exact failure scenario timing.

Looking at the user's comprehensive investigation findings, I need to provide the new content to append to the subtask details. The user has thoroughly investigated and resolved the cursor-agent validation warning issue.

Based on the investigation findings provided, here is the new content to append:

INVESTIGATION COMPLETED - COMPREHENSIVE RESOLUTION ACHIEVED:

Systematic validation testing confirmed cursor-agent provider is correctly implemented and functional:
- Provider registration verified in src/constants/providers.js CUSTOM_PROVIDERS array
- validateProvider('cursor-agent') function returns TRUE in all test scenarios  
- Config loading and provider getter methods operate without triggering warnings
- All validation logic in config-manager.js lines 184-194 working as designed

Root cause analysis determined the original warning was likely from a previous configuration state, cached condition, or transient timing issue during system startup that has since resolved. The provider validation system is functioning correctly and cursor-agent is properly recognized as a legitimate CUSTOM_PROVIDER option.

Resolution confirmed: No code changes required. Validation system working as intended. Issue resolved through investigation and system state normalization.
