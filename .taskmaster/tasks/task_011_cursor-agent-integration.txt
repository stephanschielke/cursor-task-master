# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Advanced Progress Tracking System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive visual progress tracking for cursor-agent operations with real-time feedback, token usage monitoring, recursive operation depth tracking, and multi-step progress indicators that integrates with existing progress framework.
# Details:
Build advanced progress tracking system: 1) Extend existing ProgressTracker class from Task 5 to support cursor-agent operations with real-time visual feedback using enhanced ASCII progress bars, spinners, and multi-line displays, 2) Implement token usage monitoring that tracks input/output tokens, cost calculations, and rate limiting for cursor-agent operations with live updates in CLI and MCP contexts, 3) Create recursive operation depth tracking that visualizes nested MCP calls, task expansions, and autonomous workflows with hierarchical progress trees showing parent-child relationships, 4) Add multi-step progress indicators for complex workflows including PRD processing, recursive task optimization, and autonomous agent operations with percentage completion and ETA calculations, 5) Implement WebSocket-based real-time progress streaming for Cursor IDE integration with structured progress events, 6) Create progress persistence and resumption capabilities for long-running operations with checkpoint management, 7) Add performance metrics collection including operation timing, resource usage, and throughput monitoring with historical trending, 8) Implement progress aggregation for parallel operations running in tmux sessions with consolidated status reporting, 9) Create customizable progress themes and verbosity levels for different user preferences and contexts, 10) Add progress export capabilities for workflow analysis and debugging with detailed execution logs and timing breakdowns.

# Test Strategy:
Test progress tracking accuracy with mock cursor-agent operations of varying complexity. Verify real-time visual feedback rendering in both CLI and MCP contexts with different terminal sizes and capabilities. Test token usage monitoring with mock API responses containing usage data. Integration tests for recursive operation depth tracking using actual MCP recursive calls. Test multi-step progress indicators with simulated long-running PRD processing workflows. Verify WebSocket progress streaming with mock Cursor IDE connections. Test progress persistence and resumption with interrupted operations. Performance tests to ensure progress tracking overhead remains under 5% of total operation time. Load tests with multiple parallel tmux sessions to verify progress aggregation. End-to-end tests integrating with existing progress framework from upstream enhancements.
