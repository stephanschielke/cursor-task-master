# Task ID: 9
# Title: Finalize CursorAgentProvider Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Complete the implementation of the existing CursorAgentProvider class by adding final enhancements and validation to ensure production readiness for cursor-agent CLI operations.
# Details:
Finalize CursorAgentProvider implementation with focused enhancements: 1) Validate and optimize existing tmux session management with proper cleanup verification, 2) Test and refine JSON auto-repair system for remaining edge cases in cursor-agent responses, 3) Verify timeout management configuration is properly applied across all operation types, 4) Test error recovery mechanisms and ensure proper failover behavior, 5) Validate cursor-agent CLI health monitoring and provider failover functionality, 6) Ensure streaming response handling works correctly for long operations, 7) Verify logging and telemetry collection is capturing all necessary metrics, 8) Test workspace context injection with various project structures, 9) Validate response caching performance and cache invalidation, 10) Complete configuration validation for all cursor-agent settings.

# Test Strategy:
Focus on integration testing with actual cursor-agent CLI to verify existing functionality. Test core workflows including model switching, response handling, and error scenarios. Validate tmux session cleanup and timeout behavior. Test JSON repair with common malformed response patterns. Verify workspace context injection improves response quality. Basic performance validation for caching and concurrent operations.
