# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a sophisticated recursive MCP calling framework that enables cursor-agent to dynamically orchestrate TaskMaster operations through advanced state synchronization, distributed transaction management, and intelligent workflow optimization with enterprise-grade reliability patterns.
# Details:
Build comprehensive enterprise-grade recursive MCP integration framework: 1) Create RecursiveMCPClient class with advanced connection pooling, connection health monitoring, and automatic failover capabilities across multiple MCP server instances, enabling cursor-agent to dynamically invoke expand_task, scope_up_task, scope_down_task, add_task, and update_task with distributed load balancing and fault tolerance, 2) Implement autonomous task optimization engine with machine learning-based complexity prediction models that can analyze TaskMaster state using statistical analysis, dependency graph algorithms, and recursive modification patterns with intelligent depth limiting based on system resources, CPU usage, memory constraints, and concurrent operation limits, 3) Add distributed MCP state synchronization system using event sourcing patterns, CQRS architecture, and vector clocks that maintains consistency during recursive operations across multiple cursor-agent instances, including ACID-compliant transaction-like rollback capabilities with compensation actions, conflict resolution strategies, and eventual consistency guarantees for failed recursive workflows, 4) Create self-governing workflow execution engine with finite state machines, workflow orchestration patterns, and intelligent task scheduling that can autonomously expand underscoped tasks using complexity heuristics, scope down overscoped tasks using resource optimization algorithms, and add missing dependencies discovered during static analysis, dynamic dependency injection, and runtime dependency resolution, 5) Implement comprehensive recursive operation telemetry with distributed tracing, structured logging, metrics collection, and real-time progress tracking that provides visibility into nested MCP calls, performance bottlenecks, error propagation patterns, and their cascading effects on TaskMaster state with alerting and monitoring dashboards, 6) Add sophisticated circuit breaker patterns with exponential backoff, jitter algorithms, bulkhead isolation, and adaptive recursive depth limits (configurable: 3-10 levels) with dynamic adjustment based on system load, error rates, and resource availability to prevent infinite recursion loops, cascade failures, and resource exhaustion scenarios, 7) Create advanced workspace context integration with semantic analysis, code dependency graphs, and git diff processing that allows recursive MCP calls to leverage cursor-agent's --with-diffs capability for enhanced task generation using AST parsing, code similarity metrics, and contextual task optimization based on codebase patterns and architectural constraints, 8) Implement autonomous dependency resolution engine with topological sorting, circular dependency detection, and conflict resolution strategies that can recursively reorganize task structures using graph algorithms, constraint satisfaction, and optimization heuristics based on discovered relationships, technical requirements, and business priorities, 9) Add sophisticated MCP operation queuing with priority-based scheduling, rate limiting, batch optimization, and dead letter queue handling for efficient recursive workflows that minimize state conflicts using pessimistic locking, optimistic concurrency control, and distributed consensus algorithms, 10) Create comprehensive audit system with immutable logging, cryptographic integrity verification, compliance reporting, and forensic analysis capabilities for all recursive MCP modifications to TaskMaster state with change tracking, rollback history, and regulatory compliance features, 11) Implement advanced error recovery mechanisms with retry policies, graceful degradation, partial failure handling, and automatic repair strategies for corrupted recursive workflows, 12) Add real-time collaboration support with operational transformation, conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs), and multi-user concurrent editing capabilities for recursive MCP operations across distributed cursor-agent sessions, 13) Create performance optimization engine with caching strategies, predictive prefetching, lazy loading, and resource pooling for recursive MCP calls with benchmarking, profiling, and automatic tuning capabilities.
