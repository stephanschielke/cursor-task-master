# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Recursive MCP Operation Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build framework for recursive MCP operations with hardware-limited recursion depth and autonomous task optimization capabilities.
# Details:
Create recursive MCP operation framework: 1) Implement RecursiveMCPOperation schema with operationType, recursionDepth tracking, and maxRecursionDepth limits, 2) Add hardware-based recursion limits using system resource monitoring (CPU/Memory), 3) Implement recursive workflow orchestration for expand_task, scope_up_task, scope_down_task operations, 4) Create autonomous task optimization engine that can recursively call MCP tools to modify TaskMaster state, 5) Add circuit breaker patterns to prevent infinite recursion loops, 6) Implement progress callbacks for recursive operation visibility, 7) Create error recovery mechanisms with continue_next_iteration strategy, 8) Add recursive dependency resolution and task reorganization capabilities. Include real-time complexity analysis integration.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for recursion depth tracking and limits. Test circuit breaker functionality with mock infinite loops. Verify progress tracking for nested recursive operations. Integration tests with actual TaskMaster state modifications. Load tests to verify hardware-based limits.
