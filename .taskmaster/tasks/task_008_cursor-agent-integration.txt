# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Autonomous Agent Workflow Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Build autonomous workflow engine that can execute complete development workflows overnight using recursive cursor-agent operations and MCP state modifications.
# Details:
Implement autonomous agent workflow engine: 1) Create WorkflowOrchestrator that can execute multi-phase development workflows autonomously, 2) Implement autonomous task execution using cursor-agent with recursive MCP state modifications, 3) Add intelligent workflow planning that can adapt based on intermediate results, 4) Create autonomous code generation integration using cursor-agent workspace context, 5) Implement self-monitoring and course correction for long-running workflows, 6) Add workflow checkpointing and resume capabilities for overnight operations, 7) Create governance controls for autonomous operations with configurable limits and human intervention points, 8) Implement distributed workflow capabilities for complex multi-component development. Include comprehensive logging and audit trails for autonomous operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test autonomous workflow execution with mock development scenarios. Verify workflow checkpointing and resume functionality. Integration tests with actual code generation and task modifications. Test governance controls and human intervention points. End-to-end tests for complete PRD-to-product workflows.
