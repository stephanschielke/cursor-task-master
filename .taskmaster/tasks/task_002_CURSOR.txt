# Task ID: 2
# Title: Fix Research MCP Integration Timeouts Blocking SOC2 Work
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve research function timeouts and stability issues that are disrupting SOC2 workflows
# Details:

**URGENT**: Fix research MCP integration timeouts that are blocking time-critical SOC2 implementation work.

**Current Situation**:
✅ cursor-agent working flawlessly for main tasks (expand, parse_prd, etc.)
✅ cursor-agent saving money (no expensive API keys needed)  
✅ Main TaskMaster operations fully functional
❌ Research MCP integration causing unhandled timeouts
❌ Research failures stopping SOC2 workflows when research needed
❌ Web-search MCP communication issues causing workflow disruption

**Core Problem**:
Research function integration with web-search-sse MCP server has timeout/stability issues that disrupt workflows during SOC2-critical tasks. When research is needed for SOC2 work, timeouts break the entire workflow.

**Solution Goals**:
1. **Fix Research Timeouts**: Eliminate unhandled timeouts in research MCP calls
2. **Reliable Research Integration**: Ensure research works consistently with cursor-agent
3. **Graceful Research Fallbacks**: When web-search fails, research should degrade gracefully (not break workflows)
4. **SOC2 Workflow Protection**: Never block SOC2 work due to research issues
5. **Cost-Effective Solution**: Keep using cursor-agent, no expensive API keys required

**Implementation Priorities**:
1. **Immediate**: Add timeout handling and graceful fallbacks to research function
2. **Short-term**: Improve web-search MCP communication stability  
3. **Medium-term**: Add research bypass modes for critical SOC2 work
4. **Long-term**: Optimize research integration for reliability

**Success Criteria**:
- Research timeouts never break SOC2 workflows
- Research functions work reliably with cursor-agent
- Graceful degradation when web-search MCP unavailable
- SOC2 work can continue even when research has issues
- No additional API costs or expensive integrations required

**Context**: This is blocking time-critical SOC2 implementation where reliable AI assistance is essential but research failures are causing workflow disruptions.


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Cursor-Agent Process Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Keep cursor-agent processes alive between requests using intelligent tmux session management instead of kill/restart cycles
### Details:
**CORE PROBLEM**: Currently killing cursor-agent after each request, causing wasteful startup delays

**SOLUTION**: Implement persistent process management that keeps cursor-agent CLI sessions warm

**TECHNICAL APPROACH**:
1. **Tmux Session Pool**: Maintain pool of persistent tmux sessions with cursor-agent ready
2. **Session Lifecycle**: Smart session creation, reuse, and cleanup based on usage patterns  
3. **Health Monitoring**: Check session health and restart only when necessary
4. **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple warm sessions
5. **Resource Management**: Monitor memory/CPU usage and optimize session count

**IMPLEMENTATION**:
- Update cursor-agent provider to use persistent sessions instead of spawn/kill
- Add session pooling logic in src/ai-providers/cursor-agent.js
- Implement session health checks and automatic recovery
- Add configuration for session pool size and timeout settings
- Create session cleanup routines for resource management

**METRICS TO TRACK**:
- Session startup time (currently ~5-15 seconds)
- Session reuse rate vs cold starts  
- Memory usage per persistent session
- Session failure rate and recovery time

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- 90%+ reduction in cursor-agent startup time
- Sessions stay alive for 1+ hours with proper health monitoring
- Automatic session recovery when processes crash
- Configurable pool size based on usage patterns

## 2. Build Comprehensive Agent Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement detailed metrics collection and monitoring for cursor-agent performance, quality, and resource usage
### Details:
**PROBLEM**: Zero visibility into cursor-agent performance - can't optimize what we can't measure

**SOLUTION**: Build enterprise-grade monitoring system for cursor-agent operations

**METRICS TO COLLECT**:
1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Request start/end timestamps
   - Total response time (end-to-end)
   - Agent startup time vs warm session time
   - Queue wait time and throughput

2. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Response relevance scoring (context match)
   - Output completeness (expected vs actual)
   - Error rate and failure types
   - Token usage and efficiency

3. **Resource Metrics**:
   - Memory usage per session
   - CPU utilization during processing
   - Process health and stability
   - Session lifetime and cleanup events

4. **Integration Metrics**:
   - Context gathering time and size
   - Research integration success/failure rates
   - Provider switching events and reasons
   - Cache hit/miss rates

**IMPLEMENTATION**:
- Add structured logging to all cursor-agent interactions
- Create metrics collection in ai-services-unified.js

## 3. Implement Session Caching & Connection Pooling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build intelligent session caching and connection pooling to optimize cursor-agent resource usage and response times
### Details:
**PROBLEM**: Each cursor-agent request creates new process and loses all context/state from previous interactions

**SOLUTION**: Implement intelligent caching and pooling for optimal resource utilization

**CACHING STRATEGY**:
1. **Session State Caching**:
   - Cache agent context between requests
   - Persist conversation history and project context

2. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Pool of ready cursor-agent connections
   - Dynamic pool sizing based on demand
   - Connection health monitoring and rotation
   - Load balancing across pool members

3. **Context Management**:
   - Intelligent context preloading for common operations
   - Project-aware context caching (file changes, git status)
   - Context cache warming based on usage patterns
   - Efficient context serialization/deserialization

**IMPLEMENTATION**:
- Build session cache manager in src/utils/session-cache.js
- Implement connection pool in src/ai-providers/cursor-agent.js

### Details:
**PROBLEM**: Need intelligent orchestration that can make strategic decisions about agent operations based on real performance data

**SOLUTION**: Build decision framework that uses collected metrics to make smart operational decisions

**DECISION CATEGORIES**:
1. **Scaling Decisions**:
   - When to scale up: High demand, slow response times, queue buildup
   - When to scale down: Low utilization, excessive resource usage
   - Dynamic pool size adjustment based on usage patterns

2. **Quality Decisions**:
   - When to retry: Poor quality responses, context mismatches
   - When to switch providers: Consistent failures, performance degradation
   - When to enhance context: Low relevance scores

3. **Recovery Decisions**:
   - When to abort: Excessive failures, timeout thresholds exceeded
   - When to fallback: Primary provider unavailable, degraded performance
   - When to restart: Session corruption, memory leaks detected

4. **Optimization Decisions**:
   - When to warm sessions: Usage pattern predictions
   - When to cache invalidate: Code changes, context staleness
   - When to preload context: Anticipated operations

**DECISION FRAMEWORK**:
- **Metrics Analysis Engine**: Real-time analysis of performance data

IF error_rate > 0.3 AND alternative_available THEN switch_provider()
IF memory_usage > 80% AND sessions_idle > 3 THEN scale_down()
IF quality_score < 0.7 AND context_age > 1h THEN refresh_context()
```

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- Decision engine makes optimal choices 90%+ of the time
