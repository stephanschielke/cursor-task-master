# Title: Fix cursor-agent output parsing error
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Investigate and fix 'Cannot read properties of undefined reading match' error in cursor-agent provider generateObject method
# Details:
Error Analysis:
The cursor-agent provider is failing with 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')' error during AI operations.

Observations:
- Error occurs in generateObject method of CursorAgentProvider
- cursor-agent CLI command appears to run but returns empty output '{}'
- The error suggests a regex match operation is being performed on an undefined value
- This prevents any AI-powered TaskMaster operations from working with cursor-agent provider

Investigation Steps:
1. Check cursor-agent CLI output parsing logic in src/ai-providers/cursor-agent.js
2. Examine regex patterns used for output extraction
3. Add proper null/undefined checks before regex operations
4. Test cursor-agent CLI directly to understand expected output format
5. Add debug logging to identify where undefined value originates
6. Implement robust error handling for malformed outputs

Expected Fix:
- cursor-agent provider should handle empty or malformed outputs gracefully
- Proper error messages should guide users to resolve configuration issues
- AI operations should work reliably with cursor-agent provider

# Test Strategy:
Test cursor-agent provider with various TaskMaster AI operations (add-task, expand, research) to verify parsing works correctly and no undefined errors occur
