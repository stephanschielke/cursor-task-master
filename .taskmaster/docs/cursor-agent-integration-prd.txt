# Overview  
TaskMaster AI integration with Cursor Agent CLI represents a revolutionary breakthrough in autonomous development workflows. This feature eliminates API costs by leveraging existing Cursor subscriptions while enabling recursive AI operations that can modify TaskMaster state dynamically. The system transforms PRDs into finished products overnight through autonomous agent workflows that can recursively expand, optimize, and execute complex development tasks.

# Core Features  
## 1. Cost-Free AI Operations
- Utilizes existing Cursor Pro subscription instead of separate API keys
- Eliminates ongoing operational costs for TaskMaster AI operations
- Maintains access to Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT-5 models through cursor-agent CLI
- Provides full workspace context including git diffs, cursor rules, and project files

## 2. Recursive MCP Integration  
- AI agents can call TaskMaster MCP tools to modify task state during operations
- Dynamic task creation, expansion, and optimization through recursive workflows
- Self-governing task complexity analysis with automatic scoping adjustments
- Autonomous dependency resolution and task reorganization capabilities

## 3. Advanced Execution Engine
- Tmux-based process isolation prevents interactive mode hanging
